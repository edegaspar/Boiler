# Boiler
A rudemantary boiler with arduino
This project is an automated control system designed for high-capacity water heating. It manages two immersion heating elements (1000 Watt in total) using an Arduino Uno and heavy-duty Solid State Relays (SSR). By utilizing a PID regulator, the system maintains stable water temperatures with an error of +-0.3 C.
